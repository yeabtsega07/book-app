# Book Tracking App

Welcome to the Book Tracking Exercise! This project aims to create a simple website for tracking book reading, allowing users to manage their book entries effortlessly.


## Project Overview

The project is structured with a frontend developed using NextJS with React and TypeScript, and a backend powered by Python and FastAPI. The book entries are stored in a PostgreSQL database using a repository pattern.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into two main folders:

  frontend: Contains the NextJS frontend code.
  backend: Holds the FastAPI backend code.

### Deployment:

A Docker Compose file is provided to initiate the entire stack. To run the application, use the following commands:

```bash
docker compose up -d
start http://localhost:3000
```

The website should be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and fully functional.
